      "Back in 2018, LGMS was the only school who accepted our son even if the school year has already started. They didn't just give our son the chance to continue his schooling but also helped him with his anxiety in mingling with other kids as well. In no time, our son became a happy kid again! Academics and social skills greatly improved. We will be always thankful with our LGMS family. ",

      "LGMS provides a safe space where our son can be himself. We have noticed a positive change in our son's confidence, and the school's nurturing and encouraging environment plays a big part in this. They adjust according to a child's needs and learning speed, finding just the right pace where each student can excel and be at their best. I truly believe that enrolling at LGMS will help pave the way towards a happy and successful future for our son.",

      "Our son has been studying in LGMS since first grade and until now that he is in Grade 6, we continue to observe and experience how the school actively performs its role in the development of their students and the genuine concern of the administration, teachers, and staff for their well-being. LGMS equips its students academically and provides opportunities to uncover and hone their talents in sports, music, arts, and life skills as well. We are also impressed with how the school has made an almost seamless transition when it had to shift from face-to-face to online classes due to the pandemic. Best of all, LGMS gives importance to values formation to prepare the students to be good and responsible adults in the future.",

      "LGMS has always been my school of choice for enrolling my son. When I saw how his older cousins flourished under the teachers’ guidance and mentorship, I have always wanted my son to have the same exposure. I love how patient and dedicated the teachers and staff are. And I love how my son has also improved and learned so much so fast in the last three years of attending LGMS. Because of this, my son has a firm foundation and I will always be thankful for LGMS for that.",

      "We moved to Parañaque when Justine was about to start in 4th grade and we went out searching for schools. We visited several schools and about half way down our shortlist, we visited Learning Garden and instantly got a good feeling for the school and we ended our search there. And we have not regretted the decision. Our first impression was correct. The school takes well care of the kids and all the staff treat them as individuals to maximize their potential. Every year we have seen good progress both with the academic skills and personal skills over grades 4 to 6 so and we are positively surprised how good the school managed to turn around and handle the very difficult situation brought on by the pandemic. Therefore, we were very happy to re-enroll Justine also for high school last year. At the same time John was ready for Casa and we knew without searching where we wanted to enroll him.",
